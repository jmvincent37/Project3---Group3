Group 2 - Project 3

For this project we will be looking at salary data for individuals. Our data source is Kaggle. 
The data includes salary, years of experience, age, gender, job title, and education level. We chose this data because it’s something we as a group find interesting. 
One of the things we are most curious to learn is how or if education level impacts salary. A preliminary review of the data shows that one of the job titles included 
within the data is Data Analyst, so it will be interesting to see how education level impacts salary. 

A list of potential questions to research are below: 
How does gender affect salary?
What are the wage differences between those with “Junior” in their job title vs those with “Senior” in their job title?
Does more experience positively correlate with salary? 
Is there a correlation between education level, job title, and salary?
